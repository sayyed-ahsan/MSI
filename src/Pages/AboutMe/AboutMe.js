                                <span className='text-2xl'>Itâ€™s me Syed Jahid</span>. I have completed my SSC in 2021. After completing my SSC I stope my study only because of learning programming. And I am determined to continue my learning and struggle until become successful in this digital world.  I am trying to give laser focus on this sector.

                                Programming seemed very incomprehensible to me before joining Programming Hero now my Point of view is completely opposite. Now I am Optimistic and l think I can do something good by learning programming.

                                I can understand the importance to become skillful for changing the economic situation of my family as well as my carrier. I trust my hardworking ability and my patience.

                                Since I have to earn money along with my academic education, my short-term goal is to become a freelancer or a part-time worker.

                                My quick learning ability will help me to deal with any adverse situation.

                                As I am a person who is positive about every aspect of life, I believe something very special is waiting for me. Insa-Allah.
